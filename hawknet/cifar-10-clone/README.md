HawkNet is an adaptation of a CIFAR-10 tutorial provided by TensorFlow

CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark in machine learning for image recognition.

http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Code in the tutorial demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) on both CPU and GPU, and also demonstrates how to train a CNN over multiple GPUs.

Detailed instructions on how to get started with the tutorial are available at:
